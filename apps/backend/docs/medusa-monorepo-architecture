Based on my analysis of the project structure, configuration files, and documentation, here's how this Medusa.js 2.0 project is deployed on Railway:

## Railway Deployment Architecture

### **One-Click Template Deployment**
This project has a Railway template (https://railway.app/template/gkU-27) that enables one-click deployment. It automatically provisions and configures all necessary services:

- **PostgreSQL database** - automatically created and configured
- **Redis** - for caching, workflows, and session management  
- **MinIO** - for file storage with automatic 'medusa-media' bucket creation
- **MeiliSearch** - for product search functionality

### **Monorepo Structure**
The project is a monorepo with two main components:

```
/
├── backend/          # Medusa 2.0 backend (Node.js/TypeScript)
└── storefront/       # Next.js 14 storefront (React/TypeScript)
```

### **Service Dependencies & Startup Sequence**

**1. Backend Service:**
- Uses `medusajs-launch-utils` for deployment coordination
- Startup script: `npm run start` → `init-backend && cd .medusa/server && medusa start`
- Automatically runs migrations and seeds data on first deployment
- Builds and post-processes with `npm run build`

**2. Storefront Service:**
- Also uses `medusajs-launch-utils` for startup coordination
- Startup scripts:
  - `dev`: Waits for backend → starts in dev mode
  - `build`: Waits for backend → builds application  
  - `start`: Launches production storefront
- Waits for backend availability at `/key-exchange` endpoint

### **Pre-Configured Integrations**

The Railway template automatically configures:

1. **File Storage**: MinIO with fallback to local storage
2. **Email**: Resend integration with React Email templates
3. **Payments**: Stripe integration
4. **Search**: MeiliSearch with automatic configuration
5. **Database**: PostgreSQL with automatic migrations

### **Environment Variables**
Railway automatically provides:
- `DATABASE_URL` (PostgreSQL connection)
- `REDIS_URL` (Redis connection)
- Various MinIO endpoints and credentials
- MeiliSearch configuration

### **Build Commands**
- **Backend**: `npm run build && npm run start`
- **Storefront**: `npm run build && npm run start`

### **Production URLs**
From the logs, deployed services have URLs like:
- Backend: `backend-production-a506.up.railway.app`
- Storefront would have a similar Railway subdomain

The deployment is designed to be completely automated - Railway handles all infrastructure provisioning while the application scripts ensure proper startup sequencing between backend and storefront services.
